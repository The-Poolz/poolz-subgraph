## üåê Overview

This subgraph indexes events and contract calls from the Poolz ecosystem, specifically focused on:

- Token locking and pool creation
- Vault tracking and value flow
- Whitelisted contract interactions
- Token reserves
- Locked balances and delayed unlocks

The data is made accessible via a GraphQL API that enables seamless integration with frontends, dashboards, and analytics platforms.
