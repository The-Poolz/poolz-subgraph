# poolz-subgraph

**Subgraph for tracking key on-chain data related to Poolz Protocol's locked pools, vaults, and token dispensers.**  
Built with [**The Graph**](https://thegraph.com) to index and query data from smart contracts in a performant, structured way.

## üåê Overview

This subgraph indexes events and contract calls from the Poolz ecosystem, specifically focused on:

- Token locking pools
- Vaults and value tracking
- Whitelisted contract access
- Dispenser reserves for token releases

The data is made accessible via a GraphQL API that enables seamless integration with frontends, dashboards, and analytics platforms.

## ‚öô Development

Run codegen and build:

```bash
graph codegen && graph build
```

Deploy the subgraph:

```bash
graph deploy --product hosted-service <GITHUB_USERNAME>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME>
```

## üß© Entities

### AllowedContract

Tracks which contracts are allowed to interact with the system.

- `contractAddress: Bytes` ‚Äî Address of the allowed contract.
- `status: Boolean` ‚Äî Indicates if the contract is currently allowed.
- `blockTimestamp: BigInt` ‚Äî Timestamp of the change.

### Vault

Represents a secured storage tied to specific pool mechanisms.

- `vaultId: BigInt`
- `token: Bytes` ‚Äî Token held in the vault.
- `balance: BigInt` ‚Äî Current token balance.
- `depositStatus: Boolean` ‚Äî If deposits are currently enabled.
- `withdrawStatus: Boolean` ‚Äî If withdrawals are currently enabled.
- `royaltyReceiver: Bytes` ‚Äî Address receiving royalties.
- `royaltyFeeNumerator: BigInt` ‚Äî Royalty fee numerator.

### DispenserTokenReserve

Tracks tokens reserved for delayed or scheduled release.

- `poolId: BigInt`
- `totalAmountTaken: BigInt` ‚Äî Cumulative withdrawn amount.
- `leftAmount: BigInt` ‚Äî Remaining tokens available for dispensing.

### PoolData

Core entity for locked pools.

- `poolId: BigInt`
- `owner: Bytes`
- `params: BigInt[]` ‚Äî Dynamic parameters such as amount, time, etc.
- `provider: Bytes` ‚Äî Associated logic provider address.
- `providerName: String` ‚Äî Human-readable provider name.
